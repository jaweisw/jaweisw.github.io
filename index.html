<p>This project uses Unity and C# to recreate the appearance of The Legend of Zelda (1986), as well as an additional level and mechanic. I did much of the work on UI, sprites, sound effects, music, and creating the overall look and feel of the game. Jackson Donaldson, my partner, did the real meat of the project, completing a large part of the game's physics.</p>

<p>This project uses Unity and C#, and implements an interesting mechanic, in which the ability to see objects determines whether or not they have collision. Throughout this project, I learned much more about the C# Event system, Unity rendering filters, using the Unity Asset Store, and creating and utilizing non-Monobehaviour classes.</p>
